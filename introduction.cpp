Expressions and statements

An expression in a C++ program looks like a phrase in a natural language like English; a statement in a C++ program liiks like a sentence in English. If we want to use a 
natural language correctly, we need to understand phrases and sentences and how they are formed. To understand the C++ language and how to create a program in this 
language , we need to understand expressions and statements.
