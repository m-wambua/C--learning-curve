/*
Expressions

A program is  a value manipulator. It takes values, manipultes them and creates new values. To do so, a program defines several small entities called expressions.
An expression is an entity with a value that can change the state of memory(side effect).
An expression can be a simple value. An expression can also use operators to combine values to create a new value. In C++, we can have an expression with no operator
with one operator, with two operators or with three operators. We can also combine expressions to create another expressions
